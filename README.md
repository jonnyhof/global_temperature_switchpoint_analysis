# global_temperature_switchpoint_analysis
Demonstrating a switchpoint model in PyMC3 using global temperature data.

The model is located in the 'switchpoint.ipynb' file. This was my midterm project for Physics 481 Design of Experiments at University of Oregon. It is a heavily commented notebook, as explaining all actions and choices was a requirement for the project.
